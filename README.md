# PyConvolve
This project consists of an application that can apply the convolution operation to analyze the system's 
response to a given input, knowing its reactive response

## Roadmap
1. ~~Basic functionality~~
2. Improved code
3. Graphical interface
4. DSP tool suite

## Todo list [2]
* Tidy up the functions and make use of Python Classes
   * Improve the consistency of the comments in the code
* Improve the parser
   * Generalize the function execution
   * Add order logic
* Solve issues with the code
   * Run extensive testing for error handling
